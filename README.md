# School_District_Analysis

##Overview
The purpose of the school district analysis was to analyze standardized test scores to indentify performance trends and test patterns. These insights are then used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at both the school and district level. In addition, we looked for any correlations between school funding and test scores in order to inform school board decisions regaring budget priorities. Our initial findings were then ammended after the school district became aware of irregularities in the ninth grade test scores at Thomas High School.

##Results
